        <p>
            When I play frisbee I typically play offense, that means that when I play my team start with the frisbee and has a chance to throw the frisbee up the field and score. I tend to be a cutter, which means I tend to start away from the frisbee and have the people that start with it throw it to me to advance the frisbee.
