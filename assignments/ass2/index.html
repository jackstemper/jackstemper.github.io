            I play ultimate frisbee for the University of South Carolina. The last 4 years I've been a player on the B team. Last year the B team won the Atlantic Coast Dev Regionals tournament. This is the end of year tournament against all the other B teams across the East Coast. I happened to score 5 and throw 2 of my teams 15 goals in the championship game.
